# HTML Class Project Outline

The goal of this exercise is for you to create a basic web application that puts in practice many of the concepts you've learned during the pre-work process.

Your project should include the following:

* Have at least 2 additional pages, not including the index.html file
* Include at least 1 image
* Have a navigation bar
* Use links to route to different pages throughout the application
* Include a basic form where users can input their first and last name
* Include at least 1 button
* Make use of inline styline elements to add styling such as italic or bold

This project is designed to give you more practice in building a basic HTML project while giving you the freedom to incorporate topics and elements you're passionate about.

The starter file includes an index.html file you will use to run your application, as well as a style.css file for styling. The project has Bootstrap 5 installed and is ready for you to use.

For more information on how to incorporate Bootstrap 5 elements, you can visit the Bootstrap website [here](https://https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/).
